# Table-Optimization
THE JAVA FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE NOW OBSOLETE.
I finished this project in Wolfram Mathematica, and the .nb file for the project is now attached. As of May 2019, I am in the process of contributing the functions I developed to the Wolfram Function Repository. The current description of the algorithm and my process in developing it is linked here: https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1168363?p_p_auth=32zs44Kz.
