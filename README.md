# Table-Optimization
This repository contains classes with the goal of minimizing the area of a two-dimensional data table while still showing all of its contents, given the table's number or rows, its number of columns, and the area of the text blurbs in each of its cells. I initiated this project when I saw that it was lacking in conventional word editors that allow one to insert tables for text. The practical purpose would be to be able to click a button that links to this algorithm and minimizes the space it takes up, whether it is in the context of a lab report, research paper, etc. The table object is an object that has a preset number of rows, number of columns, and a two dimensional double array (each value of which stores the area of the text blurb in the corresponding cell.
